# MyJquery
A custom JQuery made by me. It has the following features:


- All 4 modes of calling jQuery:
  $('css-selector-str')
  $('html-tags-str')
  $(js_or_dom_object)
  $(function_handle)
- Essential property/attribute access (setter/getter) methods on the selected elements:
  html()
  css()
  attr()
  height()
  width()
  etc ...
- tree navigation and filtering methods for the selected nodes
  parent()
  parents()
  children()
  filter()
- DOM modification methods:
  append(), prepend()
  appendTo(), prependTo()
  remove()
  show()
  hide()
- Some important  events:
  click
  keypress
  mouseover
  mouseout
- The capability of calling methods in cascaded (chained) manner

 - The capability of extensibility by writing plugins which add some functions to your jQuery (i.e. $.fn.*)
